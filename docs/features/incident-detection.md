# Incident Detection System

> **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
> **Version**: 1.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

## Overview

The Incident Detection System automatically identifies crashes, spins, and other on-track incidents by analyzing lap time anomalies. This feature adds competitive insight and entertainment value to race analysis.

## üéØ Key Features

### Real-Time Detection
- **Live monitoring** of all drivers during sessions
- **Incident count display** in race view alongside other stats
- **Visual indicators** with emoji-based severity icons (üéØüü°üü†üî¥)
- **Tooltip details** showing major vs minor incidents

### Results Analysis
- **"Crasher of the Day" award** in session insights
- **Incident breakdown** showing total, major, and minor incidents
- **Time added calculation** quantifying total time lost to incidents
- **Historical tracking** across all laps (excluding first lap)

### Smart Algorithm
- **Statistical analysis** using trimmed mean for accurate baselines
- **False positive reduction** via recovery lap confirmation
- **Severity classification** from minor (avoiding others) to major crashes
- **Configurable thresholds** for fine-tuning detection sensitivity

---

## üìä Detection Algorithm

### How It Works

The incident detector uses **statistical outlier detection** on lap times:

1. **Baseline Calculation**
   - Calculates driver's average lap time using **trimmed mean**
   - Excludes statistical outliers (top/bottom 10%)
   - Ignores first lap (always slower)
   
2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Identifies laps **>30% slower** than baseline (configurable)
   - Confirms with **recovery lap check** (next lap returns to normal)
   - Classifies severity based on how much slower

3. **Incident Classification**
   ```
   Severity 1: 30-40% slower (Minor - avoiding others)
   Severity 2: 40-50% slower (Moderate incident)
   Severity 3: 50-70% slower (Significant incident)
   Severity 4: 70-100% slower (Severe spin)
   Severity 5: 100%+ slower (Major crash)
   ```

### Configuration

Default thresholds in `js/utils/incident-detector.js`:

```javascript
const INCIDENT_CONFIG = {
    MIN_LAPS_FOR_DETECTION: 3,           // Need at least 3 laps
    INCIDENT_THRESHOLD_MULTIPLIER: 1.30,  // 30% slower triggers detection
    SEVERE_INCIDENT_MULTIPLIER: 1.50,     // 50% slower = major incident
    MAX_VALID_LAP_TIME: 60000,            // 60s max (filters DNF/DNS)
    MIN_INCIDENT_LAP_TIME: 15000,         // 15s min (filters false positives)
    RECOVERY_THRESHOLD: 1.15              // Next lap within 15% confirms incident
};
```

### What Gets Excluded

- **First lap** (always slower due to standing start)
- **Pit stops** (if lap time > 60 seconds)
- **Invalid times** (< 15 seconds)
- **Inconsistent recovery** (if driver continues slowly, may be intentional)

## üí° Use Cases

### 1. Race View - Real-Time Monitoring

**Display**: Incident count appears in driver detail card

```
Kart #12 - John Smith
Last: 32.145  Avg: 31.892  ¬±0.234
üî¥ 3        ‚Üê Incident indicator
```

**Tooltip**: Hover shows breakdown
```
2 major, 1 minor
```

### 2. Results View - Session Insights

**"Most Incidents" Card**:
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê

```

If no incidents detected:
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê

## üîç Validation & Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Clean Session**
   - All drivers maintain consistent pace
   - Result: No incidents detected
   - Display: "Clean session! üéØ"

2. **Single Spin**
   - Driver has one slow lap, recovers next lap
   - Result: 1 incident detected
   - Display: "üü° 1"

3. **Major Crash**
   - Driver has lap 2x slower than average
   - Result: 1 severe incident
   - Display: "üî¥ 1 major"

4. **Multiple Incidents**
   - Driver has 3-4 slow laps throughout race
   - Result: Multiple incidents with breakdown
   - Display: "üî¥ 3 (1 major, 2 minor)"

5. **Slow Driving (Not Incident)**
   - Driver consistently slow but no anomalies
   - Result: No incidents detected
   - Reason: No statistical outliers

### Edge Cases

- **First lap excluded**: Never counted as incident
- **Short sessions** (< 3 laps): No detection
- **DNF/DNS**: Filtered by max lap time
- **Pit stops**: Excluded if > 60 seconds
- **Recovery validation**: Confirms true incidents

---

## üìù Data Privacy & Ethics

### Considerations

- **Non-judgmental**: Presented as fun statistic, not criticism
- **Context-aware**: Beginners expected to have more incidents
- **Opt-out ready**: Easy to disable in future settings
- **No personal data**: Only uses timing data, no personal info

### Positive Framing

- Focus on **improvement over time**
- Celebrate **clean sessions** equally
- Use **humor and entertainment** value
- Avoid **shaming or negative connotations**

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Traffic Avoidance**
   - Slowing to avoid others may count as incident
   - Mitigation: Requires significant slowdown (30%+)

2. **Yellow Flags**
   - Track-wide caution slows all drivers
   - Mitigation: Only flags individual anomalies

3. **Mechanical Issues**
   - Engine problems may appear as incidents
   - Mitigation: Recovery lap check helps distinguish

4. **Track Conditions**
   - Rain/oil may cause multiple false positives
   - Mitigation: Baseline adjusts to overall session pace

5. **Intentional Slowing**
   - Cooling down lap may trigger false positive
   - Mitigation: Recovery threshold filters most cases

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Developers

1. **Import the utilities**:
   ```javascript
   import { detectIncidents, getIncidentEmoji } from '../utils/incident-detector.js';
   ```

2. **Detect incidents**:
   ```javascript
   const analysis = detectIncidents(state.lapHistory[kartNumber]);
   console.log(`Driver has ${analysis.totalIncidents} incidents`);
   ```

3. **Display in UI**:
   ```javascript
   const emoji = getIncidentEmoji(analysis.totalIncidents);
   element.innerHTML = `${emoji} ${analysis.totalIncidents}`;
   ```

### For Users

1. **Race View**: Look for emoji indicators next to driver stats
2. **Results View**: Check "Most Incidents" card in insights section
3. **Tooltip**: Hover over incident count for details
