# Driver Awards System

> **Status**: ✅ Implemented  
> **Version**: 2.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

## Overview

The Driver Awards System recognizes exceptional performance across multiple categories beyond just fastest lap. Awards appear as emoji badges in the results table and are highlighted in the session insights section.

---

## 🏆 Available Awards

### **Tier 1: Core Performance**

#### ⚡ Fastest Lap
- **Criteria**: Overall fastest lap time in the session
- **Display**: Both insights card and results table badge
- **Always Awarded**: Yes (if any valid laps)

#### 🎯 Most Consistent
- **Criteria**: Standard deviation < 1.0 seconds
- **Calculation**: Uses API `consistency_lap_raw` or calculates from lap times
- **Display**: Results table badge
- **Threshold**: < 1.0s standard deviation

---

### **Tier 2: New Awards (v2.0)**

#### 🧊 Ice in Veins
- **Criteria**: Smallest gap between average lap and best lap
- **What It Means**: Ultra-consistent, robot-like precision
- **Calculation**: `avgLap - bestLap` (lowest wins)
- **Display**: Both insights card and results table badge
- **Example**: Best 32.1s, Avg 32.3s = 0.2s variance → 99.4% consistency

**Why This Matters**: Shows drivers who maintain their pace lap after lap without degradation. Valuable for endurance racing and demonstrating mental/physical consistency.

---

#### 🔥 Hot Start
- **Criteria**: Fastest lap in laps 2-5 (excluding lap 1)
- **What It Means**: Quick to find pace, aggressive early racing
- **Calculation**: Best time from laps 2-5 across all drivers
- **Display**: Both insights card and results table badge
- **Excludes**: First lap (always slow due to standing start)

**Why This Matters**: Identifies drivers who immediately get up to speed, crucial for qualifying pace and early race positions.

---

#### 🏁 Fastest Finisher
- **Criteria**: Best lap in final 3 laps of session
- **What It Means**: Strong finishing pace, tire/stamina management
- **Calculation**: Best time from last 3 laps across all drivers
- **Display**: Both insights card and results table badge
- **Minimum**: 3 completed laps required

**Why This Matters**: Shows who has pace left at the end. Indicates good tire management, physical endurance, and ability to push when tired.

---

#### 👑 Purple Lap King
- **Criteria**: Most personal best improvements during session
- **What It Means**: Continuous learning and adaptation throughout race
- **Calculation**: Count how many times driver sets new personal best
- **Display**: Both insights card and results table badge
- **Minimum**: 2 improvements required to earn award

**Why This Matters**: Highlights drivers who consistently improve rather than peak early. Shows adaptability and learning during the session.

---

#### 💥 Most Incidents
- **Criteria**: Highest number of detected incidents (spins/crashes)
- **What It Means**: "Crasher of the Day" - entertaining but needs improvement
- **Calculation**: See [Incident Detection](./incident-detection.md)
- **Display**: Insights card only (no badge)
- **Fun Factor**: High! Conversation starter, friendly banter

**Why This Matters**: Entertainment value, safety awareness, motivation to improve. Presented lightheartedly.

---

### **Tier 3: Existing Awards**

#### 📈 Most Improved
- **Criteria**: Biggest position gain from start to finish
- **Display**: Insights card only
- **Calculation**: Starting position - finishing position

#### 🔥 Completion Rate
- **Criteria**: Session-wide statistic of finishers vs. DNFs
- **Display**: Insights card only
- **Calculation**: `(finishers / total) * 100`

## 🎮 Award Logic Details

### Award Priority
When multiple drivers tie:
- **Fastest Lap**: Exact tie = multiple winners possible (rare)
- **Ice in Veins**: Smallest variance wins (ties broken by best lap)
- **Hot Start**: Earliest lap wins if times equal (lap 2 > lap 3)
- **Fastest Finisher**: Latest lap wins if times equal (more impressive)
- **Purple King**: Most improvements wins (ties = most laps to reach count)

### Minimum Requirements
- **Ice in Veins**: Must have both best lap and average lap data
- **Hot Start**: At least 2 laps completed
- **Fastest Finisher**: At least 3 laps completed
- **Purple King**: At least 2 PB improvements (single PB doesn't count)

### Edge Cases
1. **Short Sessions** (< 3 laps):
   - Fastest Finisher: Not awarded
   - Hot Start: May be awarded (needs 2+ laps)
   - Purple King: Not awarded (need 2+ improvements)

2. **Single Driver**:
   - All awards still given (personal achievement)
   - Insights show "Clean session!" for incidents if nobody has any

3. **Mid-Session Join**:
   - Eligible for all awards based on their laps
   - Hot Start calculated from their lap 2 onward

## 💡 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`index.html`**
   - Added 4 new insight card HTML elements
   - IDs: `insight-ice`, `insight-hot-start`, `insight-fastest-finisher`, `insight-purple-king`

2. **`js/views/results.view.js`**
   - `addSpecialAwards()`: New function to calculate and assign badges
   - `updateInsights()`: Added insight card population logic
   - All awards calculated after results are sorted

3. **Award Calculation Flow**:
   ```
   1. calculateResults() → Sort by scoring method
   2. addSpecialAwards(results) → Analyze all results
   3. Award badges added to results[].awards[]
   4. updateResultsTable() → Display badges in table
   5. updateInsights() → Display winners in cards
   ```

### Award Object Structure

```javascript
result.awards = [
    { icon: '⚡', label: 'Fastest Lap' },
    { icon: '🧊', label: 'Ice in Veins' },
    { icon: '👑', label: 'Purple Lap King' }
]
```

### Code Example: Ice in Veins

```javascript
// In addSpecialAwards()
const iceWinner = results
    .filter(r => r.bestLapRaw && r.avgLapRaw && r.bestLapRaw > 0)
    .map(r => ({
        ...r,
        variance: r.avgLapRaw - r.bestLapRaw
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => a.variance - b.variance)[0];

if (iceWinner) {
    const result = results.find(r => r.kart_number === iceWinner.kart_number);
    result.awards.push({ icon: '🧊', label: 'Ice in Veins' });
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Position/Podium**: Most important (winner determined by scoring method)
2. **Award Badges**: Secondary recognition (skill-specific achievements)
3. **Insights Cards**: Tertiary details (session highlights)

### Color Scheme
- Awards use **warm colors** (🔥 red/orange, 👑 yellow)
- Consistency awards use **cool colors** (🧊 ice blue, 🎯 target blue)
- Negative awards use **red** (💥 incidents)

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Insight cards stack vertically on mobile
- Badge icons sized for touch targets
- Tooltips → tap instead of hover on mobile

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Dominant Driver
- Driver fastest in every category
- **Expected**: Multiple badges (⚡🧊🔥🏁👑)
- **Reality**: Very rare, shows complete dominance

### Test Case 2: Specialist Drivers
- One driver fastest lap, another most consistent
- **Expected**: ⚡ on one, 🧊🎯 on another
- **Reality**: Typical in competitive fields

### Test Case 3: Improver vs. Fast Starter
- Driver A: Fast early, fades late
- Driver B: Slow start, fast finish
- **Expected**: A gets 🔥, B gets 🏁 and 👑
- **Reality**: Shows different racing styles

### Test Case 4: Short Session (2 laps)
- Only 2 laps completed
- **Expected**: ⚡🔥 awarded, 🏁👑 not awarded
- **Reality**: Minimum lap requirements enforced

---

## 📊 Award Statistics (Future Feature)

**Track Across Sessions**:
- Most awards all-time per driver
- Rarest awards (least frequently won)
- Hat tricks (3+ awards in one session)
- Consistency streaks (same award multiple sessions)

**Gamification Potential**:
- Unlock achievements for award combinations
- Leaderboard of total awards earned
- Special badges for rare combinations (e.g., ⚡🧊 = "Perfect Pace")

## 🐛 Known Issues

### None Currently

All awards tested and working as expected. Report issues via GitHub.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjusting Thresholds

Currently hardcoded, but can be made configurable:

```javascript
// In addSpecialAwards()
const CONSISTENCY_THRESHOLD = 1.0; // seconds
const MIN_PURPLE_IMPROVEMENTS = 2;
const HOT_START_LAPS = [2, 3, 4, 5]; // Which laps count
const FASTEST_FINISH_LAP_COUNT = 3; // Last N laps
```

### Adding New Awards

1. Add HTML insight card to `index.html`
2. Add calculation logic to `addSpecialAwards()`
3. Add insight update logic to `updateInsights()`
4. Add emoji icon to `result.awards[]`
5. Document in this file

**Template**:
```javascript
// In addSpecialAwards()
let myAwardWinner = null;
let bestScore = Infinity;

results.forEach(r => {
    const score = calculateMyAwardScore(r);
    if (score < bestScore) {
        bestScore = score;
        myAwardWinner = r;
    }
});

if (myAwardWinner) {
    myAwardWinner.awards.push({ icon: '🎖️', label: 'My Award' });
}
```
