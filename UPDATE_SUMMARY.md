# 🔥 Latest Updates - All Issues Fixed!

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Driver Card Hover Blinking** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Race cards blinked rapidly when hovering due to DOM recreation every 50ms

**Solution:**
- Implemented efficient DOM updates (reuse existing elements instead of recreating)
- Only update content, not structure
- Added `data-kartNumber` tracking for element reuse
- **Result:** Smooth hover, no more blinking! 🎯

### 2. **Driver Click Event Not Working** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Click handler was wiped out during innerHTML updates

**Solution:**
- Switched to **event delegation** (single listener on container)
- No more individual listeners on each item
- Uses `e.target.closest('.race-item')` for efficient bubbling
- **Result:** Clicks work perfectly, selects driver and switches to HUD! 🖱️
