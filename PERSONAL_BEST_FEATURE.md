# Personal Best Lap Tracking Feature

## Overview
Added comprehensive personal best (PB) lap tracking across all sessions with real-time gap calculations displayed in both the main race table and HUD.

## Key Features

### 1. Personal Best Tracking by Driver
- **Tracks by driver name** (not kart number) for better consistency across sessions
- Automatically updates when a driver sets a new all-time best lap
- Persists across sessions using localStorage
- Displays personal celebration for PB improvements

### 2. Race Table Display
Each driver now shows:
- **PB**: Personal best lap time (in gold)
- **Gap to PB**: Current lap time compared to personal best
  - Green text = faster than PB (negative gap)
  - Red text = slower than PB (positive gap)

### 3. HUD Display
Added two new cards in the timing grid:
- **PERSONAL BEST**: Shows all-time personal best lap time
- **GAP TO PB**: Shows gap between last lap and personal best
  - Updates on every lap
  - Color-coded for easy reading

### 4. Lap History Enhancement
Each lap in the history now shows:
- Session best delta (existing)
- **PB gap** (new) - displayed in 4th column
- Gold border highlight on laps that are the personal best

## Kart Identification Strategy

### Question: Is `kart_id` and `kart_number` considered to ensure uniqueness?

**Answer**: The implementation uses **driver name** for tracking personal records, not kart numbers.

**Reasoning**:
1. **`kart_id`**: Database ID (e.g., 154, 137) - can change between sessions
2. **`kart_number`**: Display number (e.g., "14", "05") - can be reassigned to different drivers
3. **`driver name`** (`run.name`): Most stable identifier across sessions

**Implementation Details**:
- Personal records are stored by `run.name` (driver name)
- Each record stores: `{ bestLap, bestLapFormatted, kartNumber, timestamp }`
- When displaying, we match by current driver's name
- This ensures drivers keep their PB even if they use different karts

### Why Not Use Kart Number?

If kart numbers can change or be reassigned:
- Driver "John Smith" in Kart #14 today
- Driver "John Smith" in Kart #08 next week
- **Same person should keep their PB** ‚úÖ

Using kart_number would create separate records for each kart, which isn't what we want for personal tracking.

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **`js/services/lap-tracker.service.js`**
   - Added `updatePersonalRecords()` - tracks and updates PBs
   - Added `getPersonalBest()` - retrieves driver's PB
   - Added `calculateGapToPersonalBest()` - calculates time difference

2. **`js/app.main.js`**
   - Modified `handleNewLap()` to update personal records on every lap
   - Saves PBs to localStorage automatically
   - Added celebration for new personal bests

3. **`js/views/race.view.js`**
   - Updated to accept `personalRecords` parameter
   - Modified race item rendering to show PB and gap
   - Color-coded gap display (green=faster, red=slower)

4. **`js/views/hud.view.js`**
   - Updated HUD to show personal best card
   - Added gap to PB card
   - Enhanced lap history with PB gap column
   - Gold border highlight for PB laps

5. **`index.html`**
   - Added `hud-card-personal-best` element
   - Added `hud-card-pb-gap` element

6. **`styles.css`**
   - Added `.personal-best` styling (gold border)
   - Added `.hud-lap-pb-gap` styling
   - Added gap color classes (`.gap-positive`, `.gap-negative`)
   - Added `.pb` class for gold PB display

## Data Structure

### Personal Records Format:
```javascript
{
  "Snaver Singh Mann": {
    "bestLap": 26521,              // Raw time in ms
    "bestLapFormatted": "26.521",  // Formatted display
    "kartNumber": "14",            // Kart when PB was set
    "timestamp": 1760281356000,    // When PB was set
    "sessionName": null            // Optional session info
  },
  "Arnav singh Padda": {
    "bestLap": 27839,
    "bestLapFormatted": "27.839",
    "kartNumber": "05",
    "timestamp": 1760281360000
  }
}
```

## User Experience

### When a New PB is Set:
1. Console log: `üèÜ New Personal Best for [Name]: [Time]`
2. Saved to localStorage immediately
3. If it's the selected driver: haptic feedback + celebration sound
4. Gold border appears on that lap in history

### Display Colors:
- **Personal Best Time**: Gold (`#ffd700`)
- **Gap to PB** (faster): Green (`#00ff88`)
- **Gap to PB** (slower): Red (`#ff6b6b`)

## Security Compliance

‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets
‚úÖ Uses localStorage (client-side only)
‚úÖ No external API calls
‚úÖ Data persists locally per device

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Export/import personal records
2. PB history graph over time
3. Track PB per track/venue
4. Compare PB with friends
5. PB achievements system

## Testing

To test:
1. Select a driver in the Race tab
2. Wait for them to complete laps
3. Check Race table for "PB" and "Gap to PB" fields
4. Switch to HUD tab to see PB cards
5. Check lap history for PB gap column
6. Refresh page - PBs should persist
